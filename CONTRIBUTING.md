# We Use ([Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to share script for maintainability & easy to review:

### How to :
- Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
- Add your script in the folder corresponding to its category.
- Create inside your own folder a readme to explain the purpose/utility of your scripts ! (videos, gif, images, proof of concept...). If the readme isn't corresponding to or not included to the folder, it won't pass the review.
- Finally issue that pull request! So a mainteners can review what you have submited !

- Later, if you make change to your scripts, please update your documentation.
